Your task is to identify a strategic trade opportunity with {opponent_team_name}.

**My Team ({my_team_name}) Roster:**
{my_roster}

**Opponent's Team ({opponent_team_name}) Roster:**
{opponent_roster}

**Your Objective:**
1.  **Analyze both rosters:** Identify my team's areas of surplus and need. Do the same for the opponent's team.
2.  **Find a complementary trade:** Pinpoint players that could be swapped to address each team's needs and leverage their surpluses.
3.  **Formulate a trade proposal:** Construct a specific, fair trade proposal.
4.  **Justify the trade:** Provide a clear rationale explaining why this trade benefits both teams, making it more likely to be accepted.

Present the final output as a recommended trade proposal I can send to my opponent.
